# Javascript to go!

JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language checkout.

It is the programming language of the web browsers yo use everyday.

Its the 3 languages web developers must learn:

1. HTML - content of web pages
2. CSS - layout, style, look and feel of web page
3. JavaScript - dynamic nature and behavour of web pages

```
JavaScript was previously used mainly for making webpages interactive such as 
form validation, animation, etc. 
Nowadays, JavaScript is also used in many other areas 
such as server-side development, mobile app development and so on.

# What can JS do?

It can add two numbers together in any browser console using

```javascript
console.log(45+2)
```

You can create variables, functions, loops, conditions, and many more.

It is really used to interact, modify and change HTML content. 

For example, given an html element with `id=demo` you can change its text with:

```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript"; 
```

It can do much more like changing images on button request, changing CSS, and much more. In the next few lessons we will be learning the basics:

# Setup in VS Code and Browser Console

1. Install visual studio code

2. Install the `Live Server` extension

3. Open a new folder where you want to store your code

4. Create two files called `index.html` and `main.js`

5. Populate the `index.html` file with the following default:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

In VS Code there is a shortcut to get this by pressing `!` + `tab` key.

6. Then right-click on `index.html` and select `Open with Live Server` and a new browser will open

7. It is preferable that you use Chrome

8. You should see your `index.html` content being now displayed in your browser like:

9. Chrome is the suggested browser to use. To get the browser console press `F12` on a windows machine for Chrome, Firefox and Edge. Or to go their manually on Chrome go to the `three dots`, `more tools`, then `developer tools`

10. Then select `console`:
